Zipline is a Python library for backtesting trading strategies. It allows you to develop and test strategies using real-world data in a simulated environment.
The code we've been working on is not similar to Zipline in that it's not designed for backtesting trading strategies.
Instead, it's a simple script to calculate financial metrics (ROI, ROE, and CAGR) for a specific stock using data from Yahoo Finance.
If you're interested in backtesting trading strategies, you might want to consider using Zipline or a similar library. 
These libraries provide a lot of functionality for developing, testing, and optimizing trading strategies. However, they also require a good understanding of both programming and financial markets to use effectively.
